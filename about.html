        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Gold ETF Insights was founded by a small group of finance enthusiasts in Lugano, Switzerland. We
          believe that everyone should have access to clear information about investing in gold through
          exchange‑traded funds. Inspired by the transparency and accessibility of SPDR&nbsp;Gold&nbsp;Shares—each
          share represents one‑tenth of an ounce of gold held in secure vaults—we set
          out to build a resource where investors can educate themselves and track price movements without
          having to manage physical bullion. Our mission is to demystify gold investing and to empower
          visitors with tools and knowledge to make informed decisions.
        </p>

          When GLD was launched in 2004, it revolutionized how the average investor could gain exposure to
          gold. At Gold&nbsp;ETF&nbsp;Insights we continue that tradition by offering a free
          charting tool, curated articles and guides. Whether you are a seasoned investor or just starting
          out, we hope our site becomes a valuable companion on your journey to understand the role of
          gold in a diversified portfolio.
